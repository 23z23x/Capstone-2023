# Capstone-2023 ~ Accessible Machine Learning Library ~ AMLA

# By ~ Kees Kint ~ Zachary Summers ~ Clayton Jones ~ (Clayton's Crushers)

Mission Statement: We believe that the power of machine learning algorithms should be accessible to all, so that even those
				   without extensive training in implementing them can make a difference in the world.


Building The Project:

	Dependencies for Genetic Algorithm : Genetic Sharp

	Dependencies for Naive Bayes : Microsoft.ML

	You can install all dependencies using the NuGet package manager for the .NET framework
